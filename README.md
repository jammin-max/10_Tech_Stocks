# 10_Tech_Stocks
Welcome to Team Oneâ€™s Extract, Transform, and Load case study presentation. 
In this study we were tasked with selecting a topic, then finding data sources of the selected topic to be able to extract data from, 
transform the data into something usable to call to perform a specific operation, and lastly load the transformed data into a database 
that could perform a request of the operation.

Team One decided that we wanted to perform our study on the stock market, then a team member found the article 11 Best Tech Stocks for 
the Rest of 2021 | Kiplinger. What is Kiplinger? Kiplinger is an American publisher of business forecasts and personal finance advice 
which is a subsidiary of Dennis Publishing. We decided to only do the top 10 from the article because 10 is a more recognizable amount 
to pull data from.
